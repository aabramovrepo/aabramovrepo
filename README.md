### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I like building reliable and scalable software in the fields of computer vision, artificial intelligence, and robotics ðŸ¤–ðŸ§ ðŸ’». I possess hands-on knowledge in modern software design and strong coding skills in Python and C++.

In my career I have worked at several organizations on a large number of complex robotics projects ranging from self-driving cars and driver assistance systems to replicating human actions with robots. At the moment Iâ€™m working at Argo AI on prediction for self-driving cars.
